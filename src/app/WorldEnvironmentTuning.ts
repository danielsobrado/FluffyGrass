/**
 * The curve that maps rendered light to screen.
 *
 * The largest single lever on whether this world reads as the stylized
 * reference or as a washed-out photograph, and it was previously an unremarked
 * default. ACES is a film curve: it exists to make bright, saturated colour
 * behave like film stock, which it does by desaturating highlights toward white
 * and pulling midtones down. That is the correct answer for a photographic
 * renderer and the wrong one here — every vivid green in the palette arrives on
 * screen as olive, and the tip colours the grass shader works hardest to
 * produce are exactly the values ACES flattens first.
 *
 * Khronos PBR Neutral was designed for the opposite goal: it holds hue and
 * saturation through the midtones and only rolls off near clipping. The
 * stylized palette survives it, which is the whole reason the palette exists.

 * gives cast shadows real weight, which is what lets a rock, a tuft, or a
