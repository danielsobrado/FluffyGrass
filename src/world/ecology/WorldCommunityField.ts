/**
 * Which vegetation community grows here.
 *
 * The meadow's remaining structural defect is that every point in it is "grass,
 * a bit drier or wetter or denser". The macro fields already vary dryness,
 * vigour, clearing and patch density, but none of them ever *names* a
 * community, so nothing makes density, height, accent share, understory ratio
 * and clump archetype agree about what a given twenty-five metres of ground is.
 *
 * This is the field that names it, and the direction it runs in is the point:
 *
 *   **Ecology decides which communities are possible. A low-frequency
 *   composition field decides which of the possible ones organises here, and
 *   gives the patch its shape. A community may read every ecology channel and
 *   may write none.**
 *
 * Running it the other way — noise labels a patch, the label then edits dryness
 * — is what a first draft of this did, and it puts bare breaks on wet, fertile,
 * sheltered ground. That is scatter wearing a taxonomy, and it contradicts the
 * founding claim of `WorldEcologyField`: features agree only when they are
 * consequences of the same cause.
 *
 * Both halves are needed. Pure ecology would trace moisture and slope isolines
 * and read as a contour map; pure noise is what is already there. Real
 * vegetation is ecology-constrained and historically contingent, so ecology
 * sets the weight and noise breaks the tie.
 *
 * Structurally this is {@link ../grass/DetailFoliageAffinity} one level up: that
 * module already does weight x ecology-fit selection correctly for species, and
 * this is the same construction for the community those species live in.
 *
 * Cost is four lattice hashes per sample. The five per-community noise channels
 * are bit-slices of those same hashes rather than five separate fields, the way
 * `DetailFoliageRandom` slices its channels — twenty hashes here would have
 * made the terrain's per-fragment path unaffordable.
