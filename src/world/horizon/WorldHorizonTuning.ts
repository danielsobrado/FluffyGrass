 * How far the shell sinks beneath the streamed ring, in metres.
 *
 * The shell samples the same height field as the streamed chunks but at 16 m
 * where the near chunks use 2.67 m, so between shared lattice points it misses
 * the true surface. Measured across the shipped world that miss is 0.33 m on
 * average and 1.98 m at the 99th percentile, with a 17.6 m worst case confined
 * to the steepest mountain faces. Sinking by three metres buries the shell
 * under the streamed terrain everywhere the two overlap in ordinary ground,
 * which is what stops the coarse mesh poking through the fine one.
 *
 * It is deliberately not sized for that 17.6 m worst case. A sink deep enough
 * to cover a cliff face would leave a trench everywhere else, and the ramp
 * below only has one chunk of width to climb out of it.
