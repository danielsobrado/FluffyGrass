 * Where a biome is, in world space.
 *
 * Deliberately shaped like {@link ../../grass/GrassFieldVariation}: build-time
 * only, world-space, pure functions, no per-frame cost. The v1 implementation
 * below is low-frequency value noise sliced into regions with a soft border;
 * an authored or worldgen biome map replaces it behind the same signature, and
 * everything downstream is already correct when that happens.
 *
 * Two rules keep borders natural without costing anything at draw time:
 *
 * - The species pick is **per-blade dithered, not blended**. A blade at blend
 *   `t` belongs to the neighbouring biome with probability `t`, decided by a
 *   hash of its own root position. That is the interleaving a real
 *   meadow/steppe edge has, it is deterministic in world space so it cannot
 *   pop, and every blade ends up carrying exactly one biome row.
 * - Density is **lerped continuously**, so the bare-ground fraction ramps
 *   smoothly even where the two species interleave.
 *
 * Macro dryness and vigour stay global: they are sampled from the same
 * functions on both sides of a border, so a dry crown crosses a biome edge
 * without a seam.
