/**
 * Every camera-distance schedule in the renderer, in one place.

 * The meadow's most visible defect was a band crossing the hillside, and its
 * cause was not any one fade being wrong. Six unrelated schedules -- three on
 * the ground, three in the vegetation -- had all been keyed to the grass
 * preset's near (28 m) and mid (54 m) distances. Individually each was smooth
 * and dithered. Stacked on the same two radii they read as one hard edge.
 *
 * Separating them fixes the frame. Keeping them separated is what this registry
 * is for: a seventh schedule added later would otherwise be free to land on an
 * existing edge, and nothing would notice until someone looked at a hillside.
 * `verify-lod-band-separation` reads this list, models the composite response,
 * and refuses a build whose profile steps.
 *
 * Adding a distance-keyed `smoothstep` to a shader without registering it here
 * is a build failure, not a style problem.
