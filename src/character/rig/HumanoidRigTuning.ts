/**
 * Bind-pose geometry for the humanoid actor rig.
 *
 * These numbers were extracted verbatim from the original pivot-group player
 * rig so the skeletal migration can be proven to leave the bind pose alone.
 * They are structural rig contracts rather than product tuning, so they stay in
 * TypeScript instead of `world.yaml` (see the actor rig plan, section 31).
 *
 * All offsets are local to the parent joint, in unscaled character units.
 * `+Y` is up, `+Z` is actor forward, `+X` is actor right.
