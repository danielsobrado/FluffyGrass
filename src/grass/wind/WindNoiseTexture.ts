 * because the crests are irregular in both spacing and width.
 *
 * The texture is tileable by construction — lattice coordinates are taken
 * modulo the period — so `RepeatWrapping` shows no seam, and one 128x128 RG
 * texture serves the whole world at every LOD. Sampling it costs one vertex
 * fetch per vertex, which is universally supported in WebGL2; the compact
 * profile compiles two crossing sine waves instead (see
 * {@link grassCompactGustGlsl}) and pays no texture fetch.

 * crossing it at ninety degrees, with a different wavelength and speed, makes
 * the crests interfere: the field still rolls downwind, but no two rows bend
 * together for long. It costs one more `sin` in the vertex stage and no texture
 * fetch, which is the reason compact does not simply take the noise field.
