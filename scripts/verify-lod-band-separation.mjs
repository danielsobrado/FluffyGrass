/**
 * The meadow's most visible defect was a band crossing the hillside, and its
 * cause was not any one fade being wrong. Six unrelated camera-distance
 * schedules -- three on the ground, three in the vegetation -- had all been
 * keyed to the grass preset's near (28 m) and mid (54 m) distances.
 * Individually each was smooth and dithered. Stacked on the same two radii they
 * read as one hard edge that followed the viewer.
 *
 * A blanket rule about pairs of schedules is the wrong gate, in both
 * directions. It would forbid the grass micro-detail fade that all five near
 * and mid layers deliberately share -- giving each its own schedule is what
 * produced an earlier ring at 6-7 m -- while permitting any number of gentle
 * schedules to pile onto one radius. So schedules are classified by what they
 * change, and the rules differ by class.
 *
 * The primary assertion is structural: at any distance, at most one schedule
 * that genuinely changes what is on the ground may be in transition. That is
 * the claim the separation actually makes, and it can be checked without
 * inventing anything.
 *
 * What is deliberately *not* asserted here is absolute frame luminance.
 * Modelling it would mean inventing a contrast between canopy and soil and an
 * opacity for every layer, and a gate that passes because its invented
 * constants were flattering is worse than no gate. Magnitudes belong to the
 * rendered capture diagnostic, which measures the frame rather than predicting
 * it.
